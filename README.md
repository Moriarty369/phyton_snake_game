![Python]((https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue))

This project implements the classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing the game logic.
- **Turtle**: A Python graphics library used for rendering the game on the screen.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`main.py:`**: The main file that runs the game and handles game logic.
- **`snake.py`**:  The class that defines the snake's behavior and movement.
- **`food.py`**: The class that creates and manages the food.
- **`scoreboard:py`**: The class that handles the player's score and resets the game when necessary.

## 📜 Project Description

### Snake Movement
The snake moves continuously in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) based on user input. As the snake collects food, it grows longer.

### Game Over Conditions
Collisions with the wall: The game will reset if the snake hits any of the boundaries.
Collisions with itself: If the snake collides with its own body, the game also resets.

### Scoring
The score increases each time the snake eats food. The current score is displayed on the screen.

## 🖥️ Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required apart from the built-in Turtle library.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Moriarty369/phyton_snake_game.git
    cd your_repository
    ```

2. **Run the game - Simply execute the following command to start the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```


## 🚀 How to Play
- Use the Arrow Keys to control the snake's movement (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The goal is to collect food that makes the snake longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game resets the score if either of these collisions occur.
